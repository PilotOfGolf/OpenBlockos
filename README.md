# OpenBlockos
<h2>Open-source and free block building toy</h2>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This is an open-source and free block toy form factor. The idea behind this is for things to be free and accessible for all. The parts are designed with people who have less-than-optimal printers. This way, tolerances don't have to be a problem. This is for people who want a "it just works" type of experience with this. 

<h3>Specifications</h3>
The parts are designed with the following specifications: 

- A 1x1 block is 15mmx15mm. This size is optimal for printing time and for detail. 

- The height is 15mm total, with the nub extending 5mm above the ledge. Obviously, this is centered on every 1x1 hole. 

- Tolerances are TBD. The idea is to be able to print these on cheap or old FDM printers that may not work as well as brand-new FDM printers. On the other hand,  I don't want a lot of slop in the parts for people who do have a printer that can print the tight tolerances. Ideally, this is around .3mm, but more research is needed.
