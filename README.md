# OpenBlockos
<h2>Open-source and free block building toy</h2>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This is an open-source and free block toy form factor. The idea behind this is for things to be free and accessible for all. The parts are designed with people who have less-than-optimal printers. This way, tolerances don't have to be a problem. This is for people who want a "it just works" type of experience with this. 

<h3>Specifications</h3>
The parts are designed with the following specifications: 

- A 1x1 block is 15mmx15mm. This size is optimal for printing time and for detail. 

- The height is 15mm total, with the nub extending 5mm above the ledge. Obviously, this is centered on every 1x1 hole. This may need to change. but the base plate may also be able to account for XY tolerances possibly being low. 

- Tolerances are TBD. The idea is to be able to print these on cheap or old FDM printers that may not work as well as brand-new FDM printers. On the other hand,  I don't want a lot of slop in the parts for people who do have a printer that can print the tight tolerances. Ideally, this is around .175mm, but more research is needed. .175mm is the testing tolerance I am beginning with. I will print the parts on my modded Ender 3, to hopefully get closer to the lower end of the spectrum. 

If you want to try printing this on your own, the BambuLab A1 Mini is good, as it is super turnkey and has okay tolerances out of the box. If you are like me and want something you can mod, build a Voron ;)
