# OpenBlockos
<h2>Open-source and free block building toy</h2>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This is an open-source and free block toy form factor. The idea behind this is for things to be free and accessible for all. The parts are designed with people who have less-than-optimal printers. This way, tolerances don't have to be a problem. This is for people who want a "it just works" type of experience with this. 

<h3>Specifications</h3>
The parts are designed with the following specifications: 

- A 1x1 Blocko is 15mmx15mm. This size is optimal for printing time and for detail. 

- The height is 15mm total, with the nub extending 5mm above the ledge. Obviously, this is centered on every 1x1 hole. This may need to change. but the base plate may also be able to account for XY tolerances possibly being low. 

- Tolerances are ideally .175mm in all three dimensions. This is to allow users who have lower-end printers to be able to print the Blockos.  This can certianly be subject to change, and very well could, however this is good enough from my (albeit limited) testing. 

<h3>What printer should I use?</h3>
If you want to try printing this on your own, the BambuLab A1 Mini is good for people who are new, and just want to print. It is super turnkey and has okay tolerances out of the box. If you are like me and want something you can mod, build a Voron ;)

<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
On a more serious note, this project is supposed to bring fun 3D printing to a wider audience. The idea is to bring printing to younger children who enjoy playing with similar block toys, but allow them the opportunity for it to be:
* More personalized, as parts can be made in minutes whatever desired color, and have endless possibilities for physical Blocko personalizations. 
* More educational, as doing this will bring additive manufacturing to younger kids, which will ultimately teach them more than what they would have known (even if it is something as simple as how to load filament). 
With that said, this platform can be used by anyone. Many grown adults are fans of a certain block company, and this could give them the opportunity to learn more about designing their own Blockos, or about additive manufacturing. 

The current focus right now is just putting out the files for as many Blockos as possible. Later down the line, the goal will be to add more customization-oriented things.
